# Two Sum Documentation

### Logic
The O(N) solution uses a hash map to store previously seen numbers. For each number, we calculate its complement (target - num) and check the map.

### Visualization
- **Pointer Move**: Scans the array.
- **Compare**: Checks hash map existence.
- **Match**: Highlights both indices when the sum is found.
